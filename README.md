# Bitcoin Designathon 2

This here is the source for the website for the second Designathon, hosted at [event.bitcoin.design](http://event.bitcoin.design).

The planning issue for the larger event is [here](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Meta/issues/625).

#### Run it locally

The site uses the [Nuxt](http://nuxt.com) framework.

- Use `nvm use` to get the appropriate node version (23.0.0)
- Use `npm i` to install required packages
- Use `npm run dev` to run the dev version
- Go to `http://localhost:3210/`and see the site (if it works, congrats)
