    "description": "We (the <a href=\"https://bitcoin.design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"me\">Bitcoin Design Community</a>) had a designathon! Imagine a traditional hackathon, but this time focused only on design. Our goal was to motivate designers and builders to get together and collaboratively explore ideas and concepts in and around the bitcoin ecosystem. We coordinated with the <a href=\"https://makers.bolt.fun/tournaments/1/overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noindex\">Bolt.fun Legends of Lightning tournament</a> and <a href=\"https://2022.tabconf.com/builder-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"me\">TABConf Builder Day</a>, and chatted in Slack in the <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/bitcoindesign/shared_invite/zt-10sxfovaq-isViijl4RThKRs_TsAQnuA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"me\">#designathon channel</a>, and on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bitcoin_design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"me\">Twitter</a>.<br/><br/>It was a blast. Thank you to all participants for your creative energy and hard work. Thank you to all who helped make this event happen, especially our amazing sponsors. Check out the participating projects below."
