This bloats the UTXO set. But more importantly for the user, this creates a privacy problem when the user wants to transfer an amount of bitcoin that is larger than any of the UTXOs in their wallet: to make this transfer, they will need to combine multiple UTXOs in their wallet into a single larger output, creating a public link between the inputs of the transaction and making it possible to infer common ownership of them. As the user collects more and more UTXOs, they become more and more cumbersome to manage while preserving privacy.\n\nSee also \"common input ownership heuristic\" and \"unnecessary input heuristic\" sections of the [privacy page in the bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy#Blockchain_attacks_on_privacy).\n\nSolution: \n[compactor] is an app that is used to privately consolidate bitcoin UTXOs using a zero-knowledge sidechain (such as zSide by Nikita Chashchinskii) to consolidate bitcoin UTXOs in a way that does not create a public link between the UTXOs.\n\n[Wireframes and further explanation](https://github.com/john-light/compactor/blob/main/docs/%5Bcompactor%5D%20-%20shared.pdf)\n\nSlack channel: [#designathon-compactor](https://bitcoindesign.slack.com/archives/C0459PJFSBA)\n"

Those gift cards might not be usable to some users (e.g. only valid in US). There are marketplaces that users sell gift cards with a discount in exchange for bitcoin.\n\\- There's currently no way for a non-technical person to give sats in batches to incentivize a user behavior.\n\\- Furthermore it's complicated to give BTC to a no-coiner.\n\nHow are we going to solve the problem?\n\n\\- We'll make it simple for a non-technical person/company to give bitcoin gift cards to their users, even if the user is a no-coiner.\n\\- A web app which a user may paste a list of emails, and in a click, create and send gift cards to all recipients; create and track gift card campaigns;\n\\- For technical users, we will offer an API integration.\nA simple interface where anyone can redeem gift cards using LNURLw, learn about bitcoin and self-custody.\n\nInitiated by Porto.

Who is going to assist the non-technical people and how? Could there be a website / platform that somehow guides the family member along the way, revealing certain information or directing them where to look? This team will be designing working on exactly this. \n\nSlack: [#designathon-inheritance](https://bitcoindesign.slack.com/archives/C0441TK0459)\n"
