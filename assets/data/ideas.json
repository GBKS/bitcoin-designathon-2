The goal? To turn our learnings into a living, open-source resource: an Accessibility Guide for Bitcoin devs and designers.\n\nThis guide will be practical, easy to follow, and filled with real examples from the Bitcoin ecosystem‚Äîsomething anyone can use to design more inclusive and user-friendly apps from the start.\n\nIt‚Äôs about learning, doing, and documenting‚Äîtogether.\nexample: https://bitcoin.design/guide/designing-products/accessibility/\n\n### Why Accessibility Matters\n\nAccessibility ensures that everyone‚Äîregardless of physical ability, vision, hearing, cognitive challenges, or tech literacy‚Äîcan use and benefit from the tools we build. In the Bitcoin and open-source world, we talk a lot about freedom, inclusion, and decentralization. But if our apps aren't usable by people with disabilities, we're unintentionally leaving a huge part of the global population behind.\n\nImproving accessibility isn't just the right thing to do‚Äîit also makes apps better for everyone. Thoughtful design leads to cleaner interfaces, better navigation, and more reliable interactions across all types of users.\n\nBy working on accessibility, we‚Äôre not just fixing bugs or adding features‚Äîwe‚Äôre expanding the reach of Bitcoin and digital freedom to truly include everyone.\n\nAt last we can also make a website (Start with Accessibility) with helpful videos. For example like this: [https://startwithbitcoin.com/](https://startwithbitcoin.com/https://startwithbitcoin.com/)\n","Projects":["recxdo2cUCzHoY7oH","recj4SVNLLkuWHpKq"],"Project submissions":["recIcSKOsVWgnyAxv","recggzvZAXtO1Tq6E","rec0qpafzmrE0PRsq","recRYM7ml4FLB5wpg"],"Status":"Visible"}},{"id":"recLJXFRl1Zt65yOg","createdTime":"2025-04-16T11:24:02.000Z","fields":{"Name":"Bitcoin Safe","Description":"Looking for design improvements and ideas (not a complete redesign of the entire app) Bitcoin Safe.\n\nThe program can be downloaded and tested (with testnet) on: <https://bitcoin-safe.org>\n\nParticularly looking for design ideas for:\n- Onboarding (Bitcoin Safe includes a wallet setup wizard)\n- Category component in the address tab (can rename, drag to address, delete, add categories.
